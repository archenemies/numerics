- vec-wrap.R
    \- remove ill-conceived "recycle" stuff
    - clean-up, and implement %*%
    - test
    - fix wrap=T to wrap=num_wrap in backprop.R
    - continue with backprop ops testing

FHE 01 Apr 2025

- backprop.R (see notes)
  - clean up tests a little more
    - function to check each operation (using random values)
  - preliminary expansion of operations and unit tests
  - make tape_wrap work with duals and mduals, using get_desc_list to traverse

- More operations in backprop.R, dual-number.R, mdual-number.R

- Finish mdual_number
    - first finish certain things in dual_number
        - operations.txt
        - improve testing?
        - vec_mat_mul
        - math-helpers.R?
    - copy operations from dual
    - mdual_mat_mul -> can do vectorized
    - matrix inversion just do a loop
    - testing facility like with dual

\- improve tape printing
    - max column widths
