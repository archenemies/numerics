# ordered list from handwritten notes:
\- back ops testing
\- error checking (lengths ==) in basic ops
\- subscripting overload
  \- zeros_like
  \- test subscripting
\- dual helpers
  \- test
- duals in forward-traverse -> JVP & HVP
- Newton and NLCG steps
- nested wrapper objects
- regularity optimization - show probe points and trajectory
- pack.R
- wordvectors and model objective
- query heuristic and loop
- use manip? to be able to adjust each parameter

FHE 05 Apr 2025

- intermediate goal:
  \- rep() and array() overloaded for tape_var and dual_number
    \- so that we can get the back_ops test code working
    ~- and test these
    - note XXXs

- working goal: JVP and HVP with dual_number (end of Sunday?)
  - with vectors and testing
  - forget about mdual and vec_wrap (they would only save few % anyway?)

FHE 03 Apr 2025

- mdual-number.R
  - update dual checking code from backprop checking code
  - finish adding and testing difficult dual-number.R operations like sum
  - remove ill-conceived vector naming code

  - use it (instead of vec_wrap) to compute Hessians

- vec-wrap.R
  \- remove ill-conceived "recycle" stuff
    - put it back in some form so that we can have vectorized mat-mul
  - clean-up, and implement %*%
  - test
  - fix wrap=T to wrap=num_wrap in backprop.R
  - continue with backprop ops testing

FHE 01 Apr 2025

-> - backprop.R (see notes)
  - clean up tests a little more
    - function to check each operation (using random values)
  - preliminary expansion of operations and unit tests
  - make tape_wrap work with duals and mduals, using get_desc_list to traverse

- More operations in backprop.R, dual-number.R, mdual-number.R

- Finish mdual_number
    - first finish certain things in dual_number
        - operations.txt
        - improve testing?
        - vec_mat_mul
        - math-helpers.R?
    - copy operations from dual
    - mdual_mat_mul -> can do vectorized
    - matrix inversion just do a loop
    - testing facility like with dual

\- improve tape printing
    - max column widths
