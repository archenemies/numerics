Have first versions of tape_wrap, num_wrap, dual_number

\- Implement backprop using tape_wrap

- cleanup
  - each file should have separate test file?
  - use my-source-delegate to source the test file during development
  - run-tests?

- backprop.R (see notes)
  - Backprop testing
  - Make tape_wrap work with duals and mduals

- More operations in backprop.R, dual-number.R, mdual-number.R

- Finish mdual_number
    - first finish certain things in dual_number
        - implement some important or tricky operations
        - exp, sigmoid, trig?
        - improve testing?
        - vec_mat_mul
        - math-helpers.R?
    - copy operations from dual
    - mdual_mat_mul -> can do vectorized
    - matrix inversion just do a loop
    - testing facility like with dual

\- Make it more self-contained and upload to github
\- Fix dual_number double-evaluation
\- Fix auto-arg-promotion in dual-number.R and tape-wrap.R
