- nclg
  - need version of tape_get_pert with multiple input and output variables
    - this is just because we'll want the object value to see if it doesn't decrease
    - need tape_get_dual_pert - or can we just do tape_get_pert with dual_number and promote=dual_number
    - just check !is.numeric && is.list?
  - push_tape and local_tape
  - track_logger

FHE 28 Apr 2025

- test loading of word vectors and similarity checking
  - still working on smaller version of the data
- need vec_wrap class to compute loss gradient matrix for query heuristic
  - specialize constants and think about doing the same thing with has_dual in dual_number
  - don't actually need vec_wrap if we compute squared loss derivative

FHE 24 Apr 2025

- word vectors
  /- need a python tool to translate word vector databases to CSV or some standard format
  - need a C++ tool to look up a wordvector for a word
    \- create index of .bin file in ASCII
    /- can use grep and sgrep to look up entries
    \- create a matrix at runtime using a subset of the entries (e.g. all lowercase, single-word terms)
    \- (working with grok to create some C tools for merging wordlists)

- HVP via JVP
  - (the hessian is the jacobian of the gradient function?)
- NLCG
  - design interface
    - need dual_ops and back_ops
    - but not tracing actual iterations
    - need hvp and gradient function of position and xdot
      - pass tape_get_* for these
    - or NLCG should access the tape directly
    - is gradient descent simpler to think about?
      - x_new = optim(x0,y)
      - is there enough here for implicit function theorem?
    - use hvp and CG for dual_ops and back_ops
  - copy from python version
  - plot the trajectory

FHE 19 Apr 2025

\- test dual_number of dual_number for second derivatives
  \- verify that we can achieve the same thing more cheaply using tape

FHE 15 Apr 2025

(from handwritten notes from 14th)
- tape_get_pert needs variant that computes multiple values each time (for Hessian)
- specialize dual_number with has_dual
- "" tape_wrap with is_zero, is_one
    - check that tape gets shorter

FHE 14 Apr 2025

- pow(), sumsq
- test rep(each=)
- use arg names in tape_var repr?
- test HVP via JVP and grad

FHE 07 Apr 2025

# ordered list from handwritten notes:
\- back ops testing
\- error checking (lengths ==) in basic ops
\- subscripting overload
  \- zeros_like
  \- test subscripting
\- dual helpers
  \- test
\- duals in forward-traverse -> JVP
    - & HVP
- Newton and NLCG steps
- nested wrapper objects
- regularity optimization - show probe points and trajectory
- pack.R
- wordvectors and model objective
- query heuristic and loop
- use manip? to be able to adjust each parameter
