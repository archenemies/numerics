\- test dual_number of dual_number for second derivatives
  \- verify that we can achieve the same thing more cheaply using tape

FHE 15 Apr 2025

(from handwritten notes from 14th)
- tape_get_pert needs variant that computes multiple values each time (for Hessian)
- specialize dual_number with has_dual
- "" tape_wrap with is_zero, is_one
    - check that tape gets shorter

FHE 14 Apr 2025

- pow(), sumsq
- test rep(each=)
- use arg names in tape_var repr?
- test HVP via JVP and grad

FHE 07 Apr 2025

# ordered list from handwritten notes:
\- back ops testing
\- error checking (lengths ==) in basic ops
\- subscripting overload
  \- zeros_like
  \- test subscripting
\- dual helpers
  \- test
- duals in forward-traverse -> JVP & HVP
- Newton and NLCG steps
- nested wrapper objects
- regularity optimization - show probe points and trajectory
- pack.R
- wordvectors and model objective
- query heuristic and loop
- use manip? to be able to adjust each parameter
