- backprop.R (see notes)
  - clean up tests a little more
    - function to check each operation (using random values)
  - preliminary expansion of operations and unit tests
  - make tape_wrap work with duals and mduals, using get_desc_list to traverse

\- improve tape printing
    \- deparse for other objects
    - max column widths

- More operations in backprop.R, dual-number.R, mdual-number.R

- Finish mdual_number
    - first finish certain things in dual_number
        - operations.txt
        - improve testing?
        - vec_mat_mul
        - math-helpers.R?
    - copy operations from dual
    - mdual_mat_mul -> can do vectorized
    - matrix inversion just do a loop
    - testing facility like with dual
