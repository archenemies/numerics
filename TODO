-> \- split out testing into separate files
  - also need all-tests.R and run-tests
  - figure out testing workflow
    - want to only run some tests usually, but all tests sometimes
    - define a variable in the all-tests.R
    - this causes us to not run any tests, just define them
    - later we run all tests named test_
      grep("^test_",ls(),value=T)
    - at the top of all-tests.R, make a note of any functions with this name and ignore them later (e.g. test_bigplotfix), using once.R . or just set them manually
    - TEST_FILTER environment variable also specifies a regex to match these names against
    - source startup.R
    - need a script to run all-tests.R from the command-line


(handwritten notes from last night)
- tape should be a ref, set it up with use_tape()
    tp = new_tape
    use_tape(tp)

\- improve tape printing
    - deparse for other objects

----------------

FHE 25 Mar 2025

- cleanup
  - each file should have separate test file?
  - use my-source-delegate to source the test file during development
  - run-tests?

- backprop.R (see notes)
  - Backprop testing
  - Make tape_wrap work with duals and mduals

- More operations in backprop.R, dual-number.R, mdual-number.R

- Finish mdual_number
    - first finish certain things in dual_number
        - implement some important or tricky operations
        - exp, sigmoid, trig?
        - improve testing?
        - vec_mat_mul
        - math-helpers.R?
    - copy operations from dual
    - mdual_mat_mul -> can do vectorized
    - matrix inversion just do a loop
    - testing facility like with dual

\- Make it more self-contained and upload to github
\- Fix dual_number double-evaluation
\- Fix auto-arg-promotion in dual-number.R and tape-wrap.R
